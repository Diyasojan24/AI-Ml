# AI-Ml


## artificial intelligence (AI): the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans

## machine learning (ML): a subset of AI where machines learn from data to improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed

** SUPERVISED LEARNING :Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
 
 That means the input data includes both the features (X) and the correct output (Y).
    
You give the model many examples of inputs with correct outputs, and it learns the pattern.
Types of Supervised Learning:

Regression:Predict continuous values
  eg:Predicting salary, house price, temperature
  
Classification:predict discrete values
  eg:Spam or not spam, disease or no disease
